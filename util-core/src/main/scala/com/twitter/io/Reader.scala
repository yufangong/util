/**
 * A reader exposes a pull-based API to model a potentially infinite stream of arbitrary elements.
 *
 * Given the pull-based API, the consumer is responsible for driving the computation. A very
 * typical code pattern to consume a reader is to use a read-loop:
 *
 * {{{
 *   def consume[A](r: Reader[A]))(process: A => Future[Unit]): Future[Unit] =
 *     r.read().flatMap {
 *       case Some(a) => process(a).before(consume(r)(process))
 *       case None => Future.Done // reached the end of the stream; no need to discard
 *     }
 * }}}
 *
 * One way to reason about the read-loop idiom is to view it as a subscription to a publisher
 * (reader) in the Pub/Sub terminology. Perhaps the major difference between readers and traditional
 * publishers, is readers only allow one subscriber (read-loop). It's generally safer to assume the
 * reader is fully consumed (stream is exhausted) once its read-loop is run.
 *
 * == Error Handling ==
 *
 * Given the read-loop above, its returned [[Future]] could be used to observe both successful and
 * unsuccessful outcomes.
 *
 * {{{
 *   consume(stream)(processor).respond {
 *     case Return(()) => println("Consumed an entire stream successfully.")
 *     case Throw(e) => println(s"Encountered an error while consuming a stream: $e")
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * @note Once failed, a stream can not be restarted such that all future reads will resolve into a
 *       failure. There is no need to discard an already failed stream.
 *
 * == Resource Safety ==
 *
 * One of the important implications of readers, and streams in general, is that they are prone to
 * resource leaks unless fully consumed or discarded (failed). Specifically, readers backed by
 * network connections MUST be discarded unless already consumed (EOF observed) to prevent
 * connection leaks.
 *
 * @note The read-loop above, for example, exhausts the stream (observes EOF) hence does not have to
 *       discard it (stream).
 *
 * == Back Pressure ==
 *
 * The pattern above leverages [[Future]] recursion to exert back-pressure via allowing only one
 * outstanding read. It's usually a good idea to structure consumers this way (i.e., the next read
 * isn't issued until the previous read finishes). This would always ensure a finer grained
 * back-pressure in network systems allowing the consumers to artificially slow down the producers
 * and not rely solely on transport and IO buffering.
 *
 * @note Whether or not multiple outstanding reads are allowed on a `Reader` type is an undefined
 *       behaviour but could be changed in a refinement.
 *
 * == Cancellations ==
 *
 * If a consumer is no longer interested in the stream, it can discard it. Note a discarded reader
 * (or stream) can not be restarted.
 *
 * {{{
 *   def consumeN[A](r: Reader[A], n: Int)(process: A => Future[Unit]): Future[Unit] =
 *     if (n == 0) Future(r.discard())
 *     else r.read().flatMap {
 *       case Some(a) => process(a).before(consumeN(r, n - 1)(process))
 *       case None => Future.Done // reached the end of the stream; no need to discard
 *     }
 * }}}
